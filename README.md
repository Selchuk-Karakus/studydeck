# Study Deck

This project focuses on utilizing React hooks, reusable components, and passing props to components to build a simple web application that can dynamically share and preserve data that is fetched from an API. This web application allows users to create a flashcard deck, cards for their deck, click through their deck to study the cards, and edit or delete their decks and cards.

## Technical
